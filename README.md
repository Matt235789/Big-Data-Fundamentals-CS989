# Logstic Regression and K-Means Clustering on IMDb dataset

This is a report for my class Big Data Fundamentals. It analyses a dataset that I have found from Kaggle by using various techniques to analyse and visualise the data. It also involved data cleaning, data manipulation, appending dataframes, splitting columns and more.
The report will look into common factors that create a successful movie by looking into the top movies from the movie and tv review website IMDb.
